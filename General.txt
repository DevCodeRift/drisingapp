User Forum / Character Build / Guide area where people can upvote other peoples builds, filter by character etc.. There should be a central admin registry that can be used to update the list of characters that people can make builds on. By default things should be filtered by highest upvotes, then highest upvotes on the character they're filtering for etc..
Destiny Rising News area where people can create their own news articles, youtube videos, content etc.. and upvote it.
